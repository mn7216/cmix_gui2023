# cmix_gui

cmix_gui is a Front-end for the [cmix compression program](https://github.com/byronknoll/cmix). It allows you to compress, preprocess and extract files.

When compressing files, the GUI will append the version used and will append a `_dict` at the end if you used the dictionary feature. When preprocessing files, they will always end with the `_dict` added at the end of the extension.

When extracting a file, it will check the file extension and adjust version and dictionary feature accordingly.

Released under the GPL license. Feel free to tweak with this GUI!
