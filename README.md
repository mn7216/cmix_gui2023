# cmix_gui

cmix_gui is a Front-end for the [cmix compression program](https://github.com/byronknoll/cmix). It allows you to compress, preprocess and extract files.

When compressing files, the GUI will append the version used and will append a `_dict` at the end if you used the dictionary feature. When preprocessing files, they will always end with the `_dict` added at the end of the extension.

When extracting a file, it will check the file extension and adjust version and dictionary feature accordingly.

Released under the GPL license. Feel free to tweak with this GUI!

Software written with Visual Studio 2017 in the Visual Basic .NET language
